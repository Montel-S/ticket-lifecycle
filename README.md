 The screenshot above shows the ticket in the actual que. Here you can view and open all the tickets that have been submitted. Another important thing to notice is the priority of the ticket. It is identified as a emergency ticket because the isssue is dealing with an online banking issue, which could result in the company losing out on money. Which is why the ticket is specifically assigned to a particular agent to get it resolved in a timely manner.
